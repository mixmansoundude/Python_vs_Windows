# CLAUDE.md -- AI Assistant Guide for Python_vs_Windows

This file is the orientation document for AI assistants (Claude, Codex, Copilot, etc.)
working in this repository. It summarizes structure, workflows, and conventions.

**Do not duplicate content from these authoritative sources -- reference them instead:**
- **[README.md](./README.md)** -- Product requirements, Prime Directive specification, CI contract
- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** -- Agent iteration rules, scope policy, style rules, sanity checks
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** -- Fork/branch/PR workflow and iteration priorities

## What This Repo Does

`run_setup.bat` is a self-contained Windows batch file that bootstraps any Python application
on a clean Windows 10+ machine with internet access. Drop it alongside `.py` files and
double-click -- it handles Miniconda, conda environments, dependency installation, and
optionally produces a PyInstaller EXE. No admin rights required for the core flow.

The target audience is beginners who have been handed Python code and want it to run.
Getting the code running takes priority over preserving constraints.

## Development Branch

Always develop on the branch specified in the session's system instructions or PR context.
Push with:
```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Mandatory Sanity Checks

Run these before every commit. README.md changes do not affect them but run as a baseline.

```bash
# Python syntax and name errors
python -m compileall -q .
python -m pyflakes .

# Delimiter balance in the main bootstrapper
python tools/check_delimiters.py run_setup.bat

# YAML lint (if workflow files changed)
python -m yamllint .github/workflows/
```

For modified PowerShell files, see **AGENTS.md** for the AST-based syntax validation method
(`pwsh -c "[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(...)"`) since PSGallery
is blocked by proxy on CI runners.

For actionlint (workflow files), see **AGENTS.md** for the download/install method.

---

## Key Conventions

Full rules in **AGENTS.md**. The most critical:

| Rule | Why it matters |
|------|---------------|
| ASCII only -- no emojis, curly quotes, em-dashes | Batch/cmd parsing breaks on non-ASCII |
| `.bat/.ps1` use CRLF; everything else LF | Controlled by `.gitattributes` -- do NOT edit manually |
| `--override-channels -c conda-forge` on all installs | Prevents defaults channel contamination |
| Tilde-prefix temp files (`~setup.log`, etc.) | Easy to gitignore; survive crashes |
| Avoid `EnableDelayedExpansion`; if needed, wrap tightly | Parent shells with `/V:ON` cause collisions |
| `call "%CONDA_BAT%" ...` for all conda invocations | Keeps parent batch running after conda |
| No PSGallery downloads in CI | Proxy blocks it; use syntax-only validation |
| Tag non-obvious constraints: `# derived requirement: <why>` | Prevents future regression on subtle fixes |

---

## run_setup.bat Rules

This is the deliverable. Treat changes carefully.

1. **Self-contained**: no committed helper files; all helpers are base64-encoded inside
   the batch file under `:define_helper_payloads`. To refresh a helper:
   ```python
   import base64, pathlib
   print(base64.b64encode(pathlib.Path('path/to/helper.py').read_bytes()).decode('ascii'))
   ```
   Paste output into the matching `set "HP_*"=...` line.

2. **Delimiter-check after every edit**:
   ```bash
   python tools/check_delimiters.py run_setup.bat
   ```

3. **Three code paths exist** (cache / real / conda-full lanes) -- test all three after
   significant changes by checking CI results across all lanes.

4. **Bootstrap status contract**: every run writes `~bootstrap.status.json`:
   ```json
   {"state":"ok|no_python_files|error","exitCode":0,"pyFiles":0}
   ```
   CI harnesses and `tests/selftest.ps1` read this. See README.md for full contract.

---

## CI Overview

Three test lanes run in parallel on Windows Server runners:

| Lane | Purpose | Gated? |
|------|---------|--------|
| `cache` | Reuses cached Miniconda | No (continue-on-error) |
| `real` | Fresh Miniconda download (authoritative) | Yes |
| `conda-full` | Forces conda-only, no venv/system fallbacks | Yes |

The `real` and `conda-full` lanes gate PR merges. `cache` is informational.

Key outputs: `tests/~test-results.ndjson` (machine-readable), `~bootstrap.status.json`,
`bootstrap.log`, `~setup.log`.

**Auto-patcher**: only `tools/inline_model_fix.py` via the "Model quick-fix (inline)" job
in `batch-check.yml`. No other agent or job may commit auto-fixes. See AGENTS.md.

**Diagnostics site**: https://mixmansoundude.github.io/Python_vs_Windows/

## Testing

### Python unit tests (cross-platform, run locally)
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_*.py -v
```

Test files and what they cover:

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `test_apply_patch.py` | Unified/legacy diff parsing and application |
| `test_entry_selection.py` | Entry file precedence (main > app > run > cli > __main__) |
| `test_entry_single.py` | Single Python file bootstrap (Windows only, skipped on Linux) |
| `test_inline_model_fix_decision.py` | Model quick-fix decision logic |
| `test_ndjson_fail_list.py` | Fail list extraction from NDJSON artifacts |
| `test_poll_public_diag_logging.py` | Diagnostics polling and logging |
| `test_ps_colon_scan.py` | PowerShell scoped variable detection ($var:) |
| `test_check_delimiters_import.py` | Delimiter checker import guard |
| `test_publish_index_regex.py` | Regex patterns in diagnostics publisher |
| `test_sanitize_iterate_payload.py` | NDJSON redaction and deduplication |

### Static harness (Windows-only, requires PowerShell)
```batch
run_tests.bat
```
Runs `tests/harness.ps1` which validates NDJSON output structure and counts pass/fail.

### Dynamic tests (run automatically by CI)
Triggered when `~bootstrap.status.json` reports `state=ok`. Runs `tests/dynamic_tests.bat`
or `tests/dynamic_tests.py` if present. See README.md §Dynamic test rules.

### Adding new tests
- Python unit tests: `tests/test_<topic>.py`
- PowerShell scenario tests: `tests/selfapps_<scenario>.ps1`
- Wire new PS scenarios into `tests/harness.ps1` (NDJSON rows) and `batch-check.yml` job steps.

---

## Tools Directory

The `tools/` folder holds standalone helpers for CI and development. Add new helpers here
rather than embedding non-trivial logic inline in `.yml`, `.bat`, or `.ps1` files.

```bash
# Validate delimiter balance
python tools/check_delimiters.py run_setup.bat
python tools/check_delimiters.py run          # all supported files

# Validate YAML workflows
python tools/check_workflows_yaml.py

# Apply a patch (dry-run first)
python tools/apply_patch.py patch.diff --dry-run
python tools/apply_patch.py patch.diff
```

`tools/inline_model_fix.py` is called by CI only. It stages context, calls the OpenAI
Responses API, extracts a fenced diff, and applies it via `tools/apply_patch.py`.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Batch special characters**: `&`, `%`, `^`, `!`, `~` in variable values require quoting
  or escaping. `%` in particular must be doubled (`%%`) inside `for` loops.
- **`pipreqs` misses runtime deps**: static analysis cannot see plugin-style imports like
  `pandas.read_excel` needing `openpyxl`. See README.md §Dependency strategy.
- **PowerShell `-or` / `-and`**: outside a conditional, these are parsed as parameter names
  and produce cryptic "parameter name 'or'" errors. `check_delimiters.py` flags these.
- **YAML multi-line `run:` blocks with PowerShell**: indentation and quote nesting interact.
  Test modified YAML with actionlint before committing.
- **Line endings**: if you edit `.bat` or `.ps1` files with a LF-only editor, git corrects
  them on commit per `.gitattributes`, but local execution may fail before the commit.
- **conda defaults channel**: any conda command without `--override-channels -c conda-forge`
  risks pulling from defaults, which violates the repo policy.
- **Tilde-prefixed files in gitignore**: `~setup.log`, `~bootstrap.status.json`, etc. are
  never committed. Do not remove the tilde prefix.

---

## Dependency Strategy (summary)

`pipreqs` is discovery only. `requirements.txt` is a hint, not authority. conda-forge is
truth. See README.md §Dependency strategy for the full explanation including the PIL/pillow
and cv2/opencv mapping limitation.

---

## Iteration Loop Rules

See **AGENTS.md** §Iteration Contract for the full policy. Key points:

1. Freeze scope for the current loop -- new requirements go to backlog.
2. Fix CI first (pipeline/config), then test errors, then test assertions, then product code.
3. After going green, verify no false positives.
4. Implement exactly ONE missing feature slice per loop.
5. Add exactly ONE missing test per loop.
