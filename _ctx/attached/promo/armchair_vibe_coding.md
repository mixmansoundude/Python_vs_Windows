# 🌟 Armchair Vibe Coding: A Developer Workflow for the AI Era

**Armchair Vibe Coding** is a modern programming style that blends natural language prompting with mobile-first, relaxed environments.

## 🛋️ What It Is

Imagine coding:
- From your phone or tablet
- Without opening an IDE
- Without a dev environment
- By simply telling an AI what you want — and iterating

That’s armchair vibe coding.

It’s a casual, creative, conversational workflow where the human acts as the guide, and the AI takes care of the technical scaffolding.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Matters

This repository, [Python_vs_Windows](https://github.com/mixmansoundude/Python_vs_Windows), was **entirely armchair vibe coded**.

- No desktop IDE was used.
- No terminal was opened.
- Every step — from concept to code — was done using a phone and AI tools.

## 🤖 Benefits

- Code anywhere, any time.
- No local setup.
- Great for rapid prototyping, MVPs, and micro-projects.
- Low barrier to entry for non-developers.

## 🔮 What's Next?

We’re just at the beginning of redefining what software creation looks like. If you’ve ever coded from your phone, AI at your side, you’re already part of this shift.

> Try it. Tag it. Share it. Let’s build a new wave of dev together.
